Personal Publish-Subscribe System

## Challenge
I'll be creating a HTTP notification system.

A server (or set of servers) will keep track of topics -> subscribers where a topic is a string and a subscriber is an HTTP endpoint.

When a message is published on a topic, it should be forwarded to all subscriber endpoints.
